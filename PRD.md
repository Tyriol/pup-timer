# Dog Timer Tracker - Project Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Dog Timer Tracker is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help dog owners track various time-based activities and schedules for their pets. The application will feature both count-up timers (for activities like time since last toilet break) and countdown timers (for scheduled activities like medication reminders).

## Project Overview

- Build a scalable foundation that can accommodate multiple dogs and timer types
- Ensure offline functionality and data persistence

### Success Criteria

- Functional PWA deployed and accessible via web browsers
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for smartphone usage

## Development Approach

### Phase-Based Development

The project follows a infrastructure-first approach:

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Week 1)
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** (Week 1-2)
3. **Testing Framework** (Week 2)
